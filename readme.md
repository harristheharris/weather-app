## Description 
 This application takes a city name from a user and either displays the next 5 days of weather in that city or the current weather in that city. One large problem I ran into was how to format the url we use to call the api. That took some figuring out but was not too bad. I also learned how much eaiser it is using template engines. No template engines were used here and it made it so I had to make 3 different html docs. These html docs are not very flexible.
